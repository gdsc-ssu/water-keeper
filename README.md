## :droplet: Introduction
Water Keeper is an app that provides water quality improvement tasks and fills water droplets when performing tasks.  
If all the water droplets are filled, clean water will be donated to countries that lack water.  
Our app "Water Keeper" means "a person who protects the water.".    
Leave no behind one, we aim to remember the UN's sustainable development agenda and work together to improve water pollution and ensure the right to use clean water.
